Device Tree for compiling CyanogenMod 12.1


Note:
Before you compile, please take note of these
- I have the 1GB RAM version
- It came with Android One
- I used kernel and boot.img details from Android One ROM but the partitions size are from Infinix ROM
- If you have 2GB RAM version, you may need to adapt the code
- Or if you want to use Android One partitions scheme, you need to adapt.


Work in progress ...

Will eat your cat !
