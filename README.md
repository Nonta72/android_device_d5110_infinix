This branch is for compiling cm-13.0 for the Infinix HOT 2

IMPORTANT:
Device codename has been updated on this branch, meaning you need to update it locally too.

- cd cm-13.0 && cd device
- mkdir infinix && cd infinix
- git clone https://github.com/Nonta72/android_device_d5110_infinix.git -b cm-13.0 d5110

ETA:
- Cyanogenmod 13.0 successfully compiled but it either stuck on bootanimation or on bootlogo (won't get to the bootanimation most of the cases). I hope some devs can help me make it boot, especially @Xen0n , @fire855 , @ferhung-mtk , @rohantaneja , @besik13 , @MSF-Jarvis , @HostZero
 
Thanks to:
- Xen0n
- fire855
- ferhung-mtk
- rohantaneja
- besik13
- MSF-Jarvis
- HostZero
- Rendyindo
- hyperion70
- Whoever I forgot to mention
